It seems to be barely large enough for your ship to pass through.

	Aenwithe looks at the portal in pure amazement, "This energy... I haven't felt anything like it since... Captain, we must investigate this! The Paragon can wait, this is much, much more important."</text>

	<text>You are suddenly attacked by a Commonwealth Auto, its attack barely missing your shields. You attempt to hail them to ask what's going on, but you only hear static back.</text>
	<text>An Auto-ship blocks your way. When you attempt to hail them, they only respond with, "OUTSIDER DETECTED. THREAT IMMINENT!" before attacking.</text>
	<text>"OUTSIDER. YOUR EXISTENCE IS: ILLEGAL. PLEASE: DIE"</text>
	<text>Strangely, the Autos made by the Commonwealth are somehow more prone to errors and faults than the noble ones. Maybe it's due to all of the ion equipment they carry around.</text>
	<text>Even though the Commonwealth seems to value the Cognitives like their own friends, they don't share the same love for Auto-ships. Maybe that's why they act out so often.</text>
	<text>The Auto-ship transmits some form of classical music over your comms before moving in to attack. At least it has taste.</text>
	<text>You wonder if C.I.C.A knows about the Obelisk Autos. Does it hate them or does it feel some sort of comradery towards them?</text>

	<text>The Commonwealth ship at this beacon refuses all hails and attacks. Seems like words can't help you in every situation.</text>
	<text>Commonwealths might be more agreeable than other Obelisks, but they aren't a monolith, and not all of them share the same faith in outsiders. Case in point.</text>
	<text>You attempt to hail the other ship, but as soon as you do, you are verbally assaulted by the most vile insults imaginable before they open fire.</text>
	<text>At this point you are seriously sick of having your systems constantly ionized. It seems, however, that you won't have your break just yet.</text>
	<text>You wonder what life must be like for the Commonwealth. Maybe attacking them isn't the right way to go... unless they attack first, that is. like now!</text>
	<text>You wonder whether the rebels are still chasing you. Maybe they gave up the chase and went home? Your wishful thinking is interrupted by a shot across your bow, as a Commonwealth ship moves in to attack.</text>
