The Prince does not speak to you, simply branding their message directly in your mind.

Your life, to me, is but a single atom in the grand design of the Multiverse. Fight well, Renegade, and impress me - you may find yourself with quite a reward."</text>

	The being in charge of the vessel begins to speak, the very words sending your brain into searing pain, migraines pushing their way through your head. "CHILD OF MAN. DO NOT RESIST THE CALL."
