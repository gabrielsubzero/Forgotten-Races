					"Vance! For the love of God, stop this madness! You see the death and the misery you've sowed! Trillions, maybe even quadrillions of innocents have died because of the Rebellion - how many more will have to fall before you're finally satisfied!?

The video feed cuts out as you hear the sound of a teleporter sending someone in...against all odds, you've managed to convince him to hand over the bomb, and he does so without looking anybody in the eyes.

							Jerry opens his arms for a hug, which catches the Admiral off guard. He takes it, simply remaining silent for a few moments, before speaking up. "I-I'm trusting you, Jerry...please, don't let me make another mistake..." Behind him, as he breaks from the embrace, he finds Tully offering him a handshake. After a moment of deliberation, he clasps Tully's hand in his own, ready to make things right.</text>

										"That scumbag over there is a liar...you're a Wentworth, Jerry, and nothing will ever take that away from you. Certainly not the decree of some Multiversal tyrant." He contains his anger for one moment, offering Jerry a hand.</text>

Vance pulls out his axe, its blade crackling to life as he stands beside his nephew, ready to put an end to this saga.</text>

"Oh, and just when I thought the Rebels couldn't stoop any lower, before me stands a living testament to why joining the Feds was the best decision I ever made. You are a pathetic excuse for a leader, Vance. Too much of a coward to fight and die like the trillions of good soldiers who serve you unconditionally, yet too prideful to admit that everything you've done was so, so wrong."</text>

			<text>The new Vance's glare narrows to something sharp, hateful, utterly violent. Every word out of his mouth is akin to the venom of a snake, all of his old fire reigniting in a concentrated blaze. "You...you DARE to insult me with THIS!? After everything you, and me, and every other Vance across the Multiverse has done to build a brighter future, you come craaaaawling back to the very same force that crushed your spirit so long ago? And now, you lick their boots, and beg for forgiveness, running away from every responsibility you've ever had, every wonderful opportunity, and leave all of your men without a leader, all of your friends and family without the father and uncle they need!"</text>

You're concerned he might pop a blood vessel in his brain from how tightly his face is clenched. After a while of awkward silence, he simply turns away from the camera, refusing to look at his doppelganger. "...oh, you snake. You are going to regret everything you have ever done for these last few minutes of your pitiful life."</text>

							<text>The other Vance simply laughs at the threat, triggering the artilleries and the Multiverse drive once more. "Oh, we will see about that...you dirty little rat."</text>
